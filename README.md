- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsb16
- 👀 I’m interested in physics education, astronomy education, and fiber arts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things to keep track of.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testing simulations that can be used for NGSS-aligned experiments for ninth grade physics and high school astronomy.
